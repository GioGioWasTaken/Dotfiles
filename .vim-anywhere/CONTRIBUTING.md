Thanks for your interest in contributing to vim-anywhere! So much has been added
to vim-anywhere over the years by contributors like you. If you're interested
in making a pull request, please review these guidelines.

## Pull Request Requirements

I try to get pull requests checked in quickly, but many stall out before getting merged for one
of the reasons below.

1. Every feature in vim-anywhere should be cross platform (OSX & Linux at least). I usually won't merge changes unless they're cross platform.
2. Everything should work out of the box by running the install script.
3. Existing features most likely won't be changed significantly. Adding new
   features should be done with the option to opt-in or as alternative keybindings.
4. Any changes that change or add functionality need to be documented in the
   README.

## New Features

Before working on a new feature, submit an issue with the proposed design of the
feature so we can discuss. If you open a new feature pull request without
hashing out the design with me first, I can't guarantee I'll merge it.
